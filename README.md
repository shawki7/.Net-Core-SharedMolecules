Some shared classes I use in my .Net Core projects.

SharedMolecules.Core:
  ->OperationResult: a container to return a Enum of the result and the object you want to return or you can just return an enum result.
  
SharedMolecules.EFCore.Context:
  -> a context that track some details before you save the entity in the database: 
  Details:
           |CreatedAt ,CreatedBy, LastUpdatedAt, LastUpdatedBy|
           
SharedMolecules.Entities:
  -> have the ITrackable that the context use and shared entity that contain generic Id and IsValid property

SharedMolecules.UI:
    ViewRenderService a service return a component filled with it data
    
SharedMolecules.UnitTest.InMemory: 
    InMemory testing library that enable you to have your tests on memory so they become faster and don't have to delete and refill the data 
    on each unit test
